Automatically share your Telegram posts on Wordpress

== Description ==
[@publishareBot](https://t.me/publishareBot) is a bot which automatically publishes your Telegram posts to other platforms like your blog, your website, Twitter...

This plugin generates a web endpoint to interface your WP website with the bot.

You can visit the project [website](https://publishare.0x100.it/) to get more info.

== Installation ==
Once installed, the plugin will automatically generate an endpoint URL to be used with the Telegram bot @publishareBot.
From the Wordpress admin panel: go to _Settings_ > _PublishareBot_, copy the **Endpoint url** and paste it to the bot settings.

By uninstalling the plugin, the endpoint will stop working.

To get more info about the service and the project, just visit the official [FAQ page](https://publishare.0x100.it/faq).
